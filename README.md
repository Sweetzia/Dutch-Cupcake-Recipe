Marjolein van Leeuwen has been awarded a certificate of completion in Code's Institute 5 Day Coding Challenge.
8 november 2019.

The 5 Day Challenge allowed me to understand coding from both a theoretical and practical point of view. 
I covered the three pillars of modern front end software development – HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Each day I was given a new coding challenge to complete with supporting videos and detailed notes.
I created my own Dutch Cupcake Recipe written with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Because of this coding experience, I decided that becoming a software developer is the next step for me.
